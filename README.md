# Yay! README!

Hello.

Thank you for checking out my github for my second course project for Exploratory Data analysis.

## What The Codes Do

The codes read data from the EPA regarding fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and create six different plots, each addressing a different question. Please see the individual R files and comments in the code for further details.

Thank you.
